# Weather Forcasting Using JavaFX
I build this project built in my spare time for learning purposes. This application is build using JavaFx and AccuWeather API(Application programming interface). In this application I used two API, firstly to get location information when search by city name and secondly to get current weather condition based upon location key of entered city. The application comes with various features such as the display of day date and time, location with latitude and longitude, current temperature with minimum and maximum temperature. Additionally it also displays temperature felt, humidity, visibility, wind speed, wind gust speed and air pressure.

# Steps to follow :
1. Enter city name correctly.
